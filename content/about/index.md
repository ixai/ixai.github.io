description: Sobre mí

My name is Ixai Lanzagorta, a software engineer from México. I have a broad set of skills in web application development, operations, and systems administration.

I’ve been lucky to have lived and worked in highly multi-cultural environments, and spent extended time abroad in Japan, Vietnam, and the United States. 

I value diversity, empathy and humility as much as I value ingenuity and technical proficiency.
