The idea behind the <a href=https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/introducing-the-merge-queue>merge queues</a> seemed very attractive to me. Enter the setup guide:</p><blockquote><p>Deploying and hosting a Rails application is not trivial, and this document assumes you know how to do it.</p><p>In the future we&rsquo;d like to provide it fully packaged inside a Docker container, but it hasn&rsquo;t been done yet.</p></blockquote><p>And so I took a stab at dockerizing my first Rails application. I packaged the resulting code as a repository (<a href=https://github.com/ixai/shipit-docker>ixai/shipit-docker</a>) that contains instructions on how to build the Docker image and run it using <code>docker-compose</code>.</p><p>The setup itself is very straightforward, and is mostly the result of following their <a href=https://github.com/Shopify/shipit-engine/blob/master/docs/setup.md>setup guide</a> and modifying the docker files provided by <a href=https://github.com/arthurnn/shipit_docker>arthurnn/shipit_docker</a>.</p><p>As someone not familiar with Rails (or Ruby), most of the issues I ran into were with the configuration of the application. As a result, I tried to simplify the Rails template and configure the application by mounting and copying files instead. I understand this might not be consistent with the Rails ecosystem or the 12factor methodology, but I believe it to be simpler. Particularly, setting the GitHub app&rsquo;s private key in the <code>config/secrets.yml</code> file wasn&rsquo;t evident: I wasn&rsquo;t able to set it as an environment variable since it&rsquo;s a multiline string.</p><p>Once the application was up and running, the main problem was that webhooks sent by GitHub weren&rsquo;t reaching my Shipit instance (<a href=https://github.com/Shopify/shipit-engine/issues/871>#871</a>). Luckily it was a known issue and had an easy fix.</p><p>The repo is not production-ready, so take it as an easy way to try out Shipit and sell it to your team. One thing I was dissapointed to find out is that the browser plugin that allows you to queue merges from the GitHub interface isn&rsquo;t publicly available yet. This means that introducing Shipit would require a workflow disruption: don&rsquo;t merge from GitHub, do it from Shipit. For me, this is a minor inconvenience, but I see how others could opose it. Shipit also provides much more than merge queues, so while that was my main objective this time I&rsquo;ll need to keep exploring its fit into my team&rsquo;s workflow.</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=https://ixai.mx/post/build-docker-images-in-gitlab-ci/><span>←</span><span>Build Docker images in GitLab CI</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&#x1f12f;
